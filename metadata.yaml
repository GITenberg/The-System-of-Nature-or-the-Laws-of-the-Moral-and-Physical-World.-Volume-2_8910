description: "The System of Nature or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World (Système\
  \ de la Nature ou Des Loix du Monde Physique et du Monde Moral) is a work of philosophy\
  \ by Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach (1723–1789). It was originally published\
  \ under the name of Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud, a deceased member of the French Academy\
  \ of Science. D'Holbach wrote and published this book – possibly with the assistance\
  \ of Diderot but with the support of Jacques-André Naigeon – anonymously in 1770,\
  \ describing the universe in terms of the principles of philosophical materialism:\
  \ The mind is identified with brain, there is no \"soul\" without a living body,\
  \ the world is governed by strict deterministic laws, free will is an illusion,\
  \ there are no final causes, and whatever happens takes place because it inexorably\
  \ must. Most notoriously, the work explicitly denies the existence of God, arguing\
  \ that belief in a higher being is the product of fear, lack of understanding, and\
  \ anthropomorphism.\nThough not a scientist himself, d'Holbach was scientifically\
  \ literate and he tried to develop his philosophy in accordance with the known facts\
  \ of nature and the scientific knowledge of the day, citing, for example, the experiments\
  \ of John Needham as proof that life could develop autonomously without the intervention\
  \ of a deity. It makes a critical distinction between mythology as a more or less\
  \ benign way of bringing law ordered thought on society, nature and their powers\
  \ to the masses and theology. Theology which, when it separates from mythology raises\
  \ the power of nature above nature itself and thus alienates the two (i.e. \"nature\"\
  , all that actually exists, from its power, now personified in a being outside nature),\
  \ is by contrast a pernicious force in human affairs without parallel. Its principles\
  \ are summed up in a more popular form in d'Holbach's Bon Sens, ou idées naturelles\
  \ opposees aux idées surnaturelles.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
